   1.  

     f = m * a

     mass = 600kg
     accseleration = 2m /s2


    force = mass * accelaration
    force = 600kg * 2
    f = 1200 N 

2.  1 years = 365.25

if (the year is not divissble by 4) then (it is a common year)
   
    or else (if the year is year is not divisble by 100) then (its a leap year)

  or Else (if the year is not divisble by 400), then (its a common year)
